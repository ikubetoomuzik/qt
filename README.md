# Python Script to Generate Unibar Input with Questrade API

This project uses the qtrade library to access the api.
There is also some additional self-written code to access the cash available.

## File Purposes

- **current.py** ---> *Script that is currently installed and active on my pc.*
- **temp.py** ---> *Script that contains upcoming or WIP changes.*
- **install.sh** ---> *Copies temp script to current and installs it to the dir where I keep scripts.*
- **newAndOld.py** ---> *Legacy script containing my original iteration, just incase it breaks.*

## TODOS

- Add a simple script to setup with a new token.
- Dive deeper into the api to make sure the token management is correct.
- Add account selection and not have it default to the first option.
- Add script dir configuration for install script.
